    "Given a set of $p$ features $X = (X_1, \\dots, X_p)$ and an outcome of interest $y$, knockoffs aim to select the small fraction of features on which $y$ actually depends while controlling the false discovery rate. For example, if $y \\mid X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(X \\beta, \\sigma^2)$ and $\\beta$ is sparse, knockoffs aim to identify the set $\\{j : \\beta_j \\ne 0\\}$.\n"

    "1. First, we construct synthetic variables $\\tilde{X} = (\\tilde{X}_1, \\dots, \\tilde{X}_p)$ called knockoffs. Intuitively, the $j$th knockoff $\\tilde{X}_j$ acts as a \"negative control\" on the $j$th feature $X_j$ during variable selection. In ``knockpy``, knockoffs are denoted as the numpy array ``Xk``. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Second, we use an arbitrary machine learning algorithm -- usually called a *feature statistic* -- to assign variable importances to each of the $p$ features and each of the $p$ knockoffs. For example, we might train a cross-validated Lasso on $[X, \\tilde{X}]$ and $y$ and use the lasso coefficient sizes as a measure of variable importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Intuitively, a non-null feature should be assigned a higher variable importance than its (synthetic) knockoff, whereas knockoffs are constructed such that null features are indistinguishable from their knockoff. The *data-dependent-threshhold* introduced in [Barber and Candes 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5609) formalizes this intuition and uses the feature statistics to reject a set of variables such that the expected fraction of false positives is below a prespecified proportion $q$."

    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed-X** knockoffs treat the design matrix $X$ as fixed and control the false discovery rate assuming $y \\mid X$ follows a homoskedastic gaussian linear response. In this case, it is possible to construct valid knockoffs $\\tilde{X}$ with no assumptions on $X$. Note also that when using fixed-X knockoffs, the feature statistic must satisfy a slightly more restrictive *sufficiency* condition (see [Barber and Candes 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5609)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model-X** knockoffs treat the design matrix $X$ as random. Model-X knockoffs control the false discovery rate for any conditional distribution $y \\mid X$, but they assume that the distribution of $X$ is known. Thus, to construct model-X knockoffs, one must know (or estimate) the distribution of $X$. See [Candes et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02351) for details. "

    "- Conditional Independence (CI) knockoffs guarantee that each feature $X_j$ and its knockoff $\\tilde{X}_j$ are conditionally independent given all of the other features $X_{-j}$; however, CI knockoffs do not always exist, so we use a heuristic defined in [Ke et al.

This means that after training a predictive model on $[X, \\tilde{X}]$ and $y$, to obtain a variable importance for variable $X_j$, the FeatureStatistic class temporarily replaces $X_j$ with $\\tilde{X}_j$ and records the decrease in predictive performance of the trained model. After repeating this for all features and knockoffs, this yields knockoff variable importances which can be transformed via an antisymmetric function to create valid feature statistics. \n",
