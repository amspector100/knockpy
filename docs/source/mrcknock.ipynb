    "As discussed in [Spector and Janson (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14625), MAC-minimizing knockoffs (known as \"SDP knockoffs\") perform poorly when the features are correlated. In particular, minimizing the MAC often makes it possible to *reconstruct* each feature $X_j$ using the other features $X_{-j}$ and the knockoffs $\\tilde{X}$. In other words, SDP knockoffs often ensures that no features contain any unique information, which makes it very hard to determine which features are important and which are unimportant."

    "A better approach to constructing knockoffs is to *minimizing the reconstructability* (MRC) of each feature $X_j$. Intuitively, this framework maximizes the amount of unique information each feature contains, making it easier to determine which features are important. **MVR knockoffs** are one instantiation of this framework, which informally maximize $\\text{Var}(X_j \\mid X_{-j}, \\tilde{X})$ for each $j$, ensuring that each feature contains as much unique information as possible.\n",
